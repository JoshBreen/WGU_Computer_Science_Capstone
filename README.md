The assignment was to come up with a business need that could be resolved by using machine learning. For this assignment, I used a heart health data source with over
250k survey results about participantsâ€™ health and if they had either a heart attack or heart disease. Trained the model to use this data so that a user could fill 
out a form and it would determine if they are at risk for a heart attack or heart disease.
